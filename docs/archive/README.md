# Documentation Archive

This directory contains historical documentation that was useful during development but is no longer needed for day-to-day operations.

## Archived: 2025-11-11

### Historical Debugging Docs
Files from October 2025 issue resolution and optimization work:
- `EXPERT_ISSUES_FIXED.md` - Historical issue log
- `EXPERT_REVIEW_RESPONSES.md` - Historical review responses
- `FEATURE_SELECTION_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - Data leakage fix documentation
- `FIX_ML_FEATURES.md` - Historical ML feature fixes
- `ML_FIXES_SUMMARY.md` - Summary of ML system fixes
- `OPTIMIZATION_FIXES_ANALYSIS.md` - Analysis of optimization issues
- `OPTIMIZATION_FIXES_IMPLEMENTED.md` - Implementation log
- `OPTIMIZATION_VERIFICATION_REPORT.md` - Verification results
- `LOOK_AHEAD_BIAS_REVIEW.md` - Look-ahead bias audit
- `feature_verification_report.txt` - Feature verification results

### Deprecated Guides
Superseded by current methodology:
- `CONFIGURATION_B_SETUP.md` - Deprecated configuration approach
- `CLUSTERED_FEATURE_SELECTION_GUIDE.md` - Historical clustering implementation (completed)
- `DATA_TRANSFORMATION_TO_ML_WORKFLOW.md` - Old workflow guide (replaced by THREE_WAY_SPLIT_GUIDE.md)

## Why Archived?

These documents were critical during development and debugging but are no longer needed for:
- Current training workflow (now uses `train_rf_three_way_split.py`)
- Day-to-day operations
- New feature development

They remain available here for historical reference and audit purposes.
